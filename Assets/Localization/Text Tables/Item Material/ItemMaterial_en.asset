      Middle Ages, glass became prominent in stained glass windows in Gothic cathedrals.
      During the Renaissance, Venice became a hub for decorative glass. The Industrial
      Revolution enabled mass production, making glass widely used in everyday objects,
      architecture, and modern technology.
